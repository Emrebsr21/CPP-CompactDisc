# CPP-CompactDisc

This project implements a simple class for managing a Compact Disc (CD) in C++. It features basic object-oriented principles, including constructors, destructors, operator overloading, and dynamic memory management. The code handles songs on the CD and offers several functionalities to manipulate and display information about the tracks.

Features
  OOP Concepts: Demonstrates the use of classes, constructors, destructors, and operator overloading.
  Dynamic Memory Allocation: Uses dynamic memory to manage the list of songs on the Compact Disc.
  Basic User Interaction: Populates song structures and demonstrates setting and retrieving songs from the CD.
